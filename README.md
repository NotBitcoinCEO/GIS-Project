# Overview

Worked on creating a mobile app using the mapping of ArcGIS and the documentation within ArcGIS.

Hoping to create a map that has popups that are interactable in the mapping system. This proved harder than originally planned.

The purpose of writing this software is to learn the fundementals of GIS and how I might navigate the complicated world of mapping.

# Development Environment

The tools that used were Visual Studio and Node.js

# Useful Websites

Helpful website that I found useful: 
* [ArcGIS Install](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/install-and-set-up/)
* [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)

# Future Work

Need to work on:
* Interactivity with the datapoints
* Animated mapping systems
* Add filter with dispaly markers
